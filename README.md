## Instructions

Memory Game is the traditional game where you match 2 cards at a time.

1. This version has 2 modes -- the defalut Classic Mode & Image Reveal mode.  To access the Image reveal mode, where a background image is revealed at the end of the game, select the picture icon in the icon bar. It will turn red when it is in Reveal Mode. There are approximately 12 background images of which one is randomly chosen for each game.

2. The player also has the option of choosing from 4 different card sets from the Mix drop down menu.

3. To reload the game, press the reset button.

4. I put the timer at the bottom to make it less distracting.

5. I implemented functionality so that more that 2 cards at once are not selectable.

6. Star rating decreases with move increments.

7. TODO : refine responsive background images using Window.matchMedia. This still needs some attention as I'm not satisfied with the result. Used Grunt to generate the files.
